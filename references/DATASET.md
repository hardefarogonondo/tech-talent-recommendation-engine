## Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2023

Every year, Stack Overflow conducts an extensive survey catering to developers around the world, aiming to provide insights into the developer community, their preferences, the tools they use, and the emerging trends. In May 2023, the survey saw participation from over 90,000 developers, sharing insights about how they learn, upgrade their skills, the tools they use, and their aspirations.

This survey serves as a critical guide for analysts, IT leaders, reporters, and fellow developers, helping them stay in tune with the rapidly evolving technological landscape, the shifts in developer experiences, and the emerging trends in the tech domain.

In 2023, a significant emphasis was laid on AI/ML, delving deep into its integration in developers' workflows and its perceived implications. As Stack Overflow continues its journey of leveraging AI to enhance the developer experience across its products, this year's survey results provide invaluable insights into where AI in the developer realm might be heading.
